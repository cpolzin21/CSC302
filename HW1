#Use pandas to read the olympic_medals.csv from the DATA folder on Google Drive. Then perform the followings by using pandas and/or Python built-in functions.

#(a) Find the size of the data frame. How many rows, how many columns?

#(b) Use the appropriate function to report the data types for all columns.

#(c) Find how many unique cities matches were held at. (Hint: unique( ). For instance, the following example tells how many unique Events held:) len(medals['Event'].unique())

#(d) Find how many medals the USA team won in total.

#(e) Find the total number of medals for each Nationality. (Hint: please search for groupby() function with count. For instance, the following example counts at how many locations each event was held. ) medals.groupby(by='Event')['Location'].count()
